I was thinking that this would be the best environment for me to apply the skills I acquired during my internship and Master’s degree. So, I checked your careers page regularly and when I saw this job ad, I thought it was finally time to try my hand. I have experience in web development and I’m really interested in the projects you’re mentioning in the job ad – in fact, one of them was the subject of my thesis. I really think I’m a good fit for the job and can grow even more in your workplace.",
